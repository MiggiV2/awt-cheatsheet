Standard Methods

Operations of a REST service refer to a resource and can be called using the means offered by HTTP. The typical HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE have a standard interpretation in this context:
Method 	Interpretation
GET 	retrieve information about a resource
POST 	submit data to the server, often used for creating new resources
PUT 	update resource or create sub-resource
DELETE 	delete a resource
PATCH 	partially update a resource - only send changed parts
